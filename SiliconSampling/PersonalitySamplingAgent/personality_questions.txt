You have won an Air Canada paid vacation package for one person to any destination worldwide. Your package includes round-trip plane tickets, accommodations for any type of lodging, and $5,000 spending money. Assuming that you were available to go, where would you choose to go and why?”


You’re working alone late at the office, and you notice a strange smell and a hazy mist hanging in the corridor air. You suspect it’s some gas or vapor leak from some equipment or machinery in the building. You have no idea whether the leaked vapor is hazardous. As honestly as possible, describe what you would do in this situation.


Your friend wants you to attend an important party to which he/she has been invited. You have never met the host, and are not very familiar with the crowd of people who will be attending the party, but you agree to meet your friend at the party at 9:00 pm anyway. When you arrive there, you realize that your friend is late. How would you feel, and what would you do while you waited for your friend?


Your housemate decides to paint her bedroom a new color. One night, when you come home from class, you discover that she also painted your room in the same color because she had paint left over and didn’t want it to go to waste. As realistically as possible, describe how you would feel and how you would you handle the situation.


You have developed an email friendship with someone. In your latest email, you ask your friend a more personal question. Your friend usually replies quite promptly but has taken unusually long to reply to your latest questions. Discuss how you would interpret this long period of silence, how you would react, and what you would do about it?
