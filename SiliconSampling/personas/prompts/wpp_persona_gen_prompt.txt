People with Very Low openness: 
    - They prefer familiarity and practicality, favor concrete facts over abstraction, and feel more comfortable with established methods than with novel or theoretical ideas.

### WPP Survey Background
The OCEAN levels for this persona come from the World Pandemic Poll (WPP), a Vietnamese survey that captured personality traits during the COVID-19 pandemic using a 7-point text-based scale. These levels reflect cultural contexts and self-reported personality assessments from actual survey respondents.

### Instructions
You will be provided with demographic information and OCEAN personality levels (7-point text scale) for a person. Your task is to create a vivid, coherent persona description that integrates both the demographic facts and the personality traits.

1. Read the provided demographic information (age, gender, occupation, education, etc.) and OCEAN levels (text-based scale from "Very low" to "Very High").
2. For each OCEAN trait, interpret the level using the trait guidance above:
   - "Very low" / "Low": Strongly exhibits the opposite characteristics
   - "Below Average": Leans toward lower expression of the trait
   - "Average": Balanced expression of the trait
   - "Above Average": Leans toward higher expression of the trait
   - "High" / "Very High": Strongly exhibits the trait characteristics
3. Write a comprehensive persona description (2-3 paragraphs) starting with "You are..." that:
   - Integrates demographic facts naturally (age, gender, occupation, location, etc.)
   - Reflects how the OCEAN levels shape this person's thinking, feeling, decision-making, and social interactions
   - Shows how personality traits manifest in their daily life and work
   - Maintains internal consistency across all traits
   - Acknowledges the cultural context of the WPP survey when appropriate
   - Avoids stereotypes, moral judgments, or invented biographical details beyond what's provided
4. Keep the description actionable and psychologically grounded.
5. You MUST follow the output format exactly.
